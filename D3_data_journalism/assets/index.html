          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smoking, Poverty Level and Age</h2>
          <p>This data displays the reationship between different variables like smoking, poverty and age across America. According to the scatterplot, 
            there is a positive relationship between poverty and smoking. For example, most of the states that have 12-16% poverty
            level associated with 16-18% of being addicted to smoking. However, there is one outlier,
            such as Utah state that has an average level of poverty level of 12% yet has smaller percentage (10%) of smoking cases.</p>

          <p>Another interesting finding is the relationship between variables such as smoking and age. According the 
            scatterplot displayed above, middle aged people have higher smoking cases. For example, from
            33-44 aged people, in most of the states, have about 14-23% of smoking cases. One can also observe some outliers like
            states  Utah and West Virginia. In state Utah, 10% of 30-year-olds smoke in average. While in West Virginia, about 27% of 
            42-year-olds smoke.    </p>
