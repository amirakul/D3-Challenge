          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smoking, Poverty Level and Age</h2>
          <p>This data displays the reationship between different variables like smoking, poverty and age across America. According to the scatterplot, 
            there is a positive relationship between poverty vs. smoking and poverty vs. obesity. For example, most of the states that have 12-16% poverty
            level associated with 16-18% of being addicted to smoking. However, there is one outlier,
            such as Utah state that has an average level of poverty level of 12% yet has smaller percentage (10%) of smoking cases. Population that 
            have higher poverty level also displays higher obesity percentage.</p>

          <p>Another interesting finding is the relationship between variables such as smoking and age. According the 
            scatterplot displayed above, middle aged people have higher smoking cases. For example, from
            33-44 aged people, in most of the states, have about 14-23% of smoking cases. One can also observe some outliers like
            states  Utah and West Virginia. In state Utah, 10% of 30-year-olds smoke in average. While in West Virginia, about 27% of 
            42-year-olds smoke.</p>
          
          <p>Last observation one can notice is that there is a negative strong correlation between smoking vs income and obesety vs. income. 
            For example, in states like Mississipi and West Virginia, where average household income is about $40,000, the percentage of smoking and obesity
            are higher compared to states like Maryland,which has average income of $74,000 and smoking and obese population percentage is lower by 12% and 6% respectively. This
            may conclude that stress related to poverty leads to smoking and lack of healthy food may result in obesity, since healthy eating can be expensive. This is also confirmed with poverty and smoking relationship; Maryland's 10%
            of its population lives in poverty yet only about 14% of population is addicted to smoking.
